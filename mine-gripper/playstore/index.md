# Mine Gripper Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use the Mine Gripper mobile application (the "App").

**1. Information We Do Not Collect**

The Mine Gripper App is designed with your privacy in mind. We explicitly state that **we do not collect any personal identifiable information** from our users. This includes, but is not limited to, your name, email address, phone number, location data, device identifiers, or any other information that could be used to identify you personally.

**2. No Advertising**

The Mine Gripper App does **not contain any third-party advertising or advertising SDKs**. We do not display ads within the App, nor do we share any data with advertising networks.

**3. Local Storage of Nicknames and Ranking Data**

To enhance your gaming experience, the App allows you to set a nickname and stores your game scores locally on your device for ranking purposes.
* **Nickname:** You can enter a nickname of your choice. This nickname is **only stored on your device** and is used solely for displaying your achievements within the App's local ranking system. It is not transmitted to us or any third party.
* **Ranking Information:** Your game scores, along with your chosen nickname, are saved on your device to create a local high-score list. This data is **never collected, transmitted, or shared with us or any external servers or services.** It resides entirely within your device's local storage.

**4. No Third-Party Services**

The Mine Gripper App does not integrate with any third-party analytics services, social media integrations, or other external services that would collect user data.

**5. Data Security**

Since the App does not collect or transmit any personal data, the risk of data breaches related to personal information is eliminated. Any local data (nickname and scores) is stored securely on your device, and its security depends on your device's own security measures.

**6. Children's Privacy**

Our App is designed for a general audience and does not knowingly collect any personal identifiable information from children under the age of 13. As no personal information is collected, the provisions of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) are not applicable.

**7. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
